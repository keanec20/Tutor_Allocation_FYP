# Tutor_Allocation_FYP
The objective of this project was to develop an automated system for allocating students to 
tutors for the Senior Tutorâ€™s Office of Trinity College Dublin. The project involved learning about 
the tutor system and identifying the different types of constraints within. The system combines a 
Python-based allocation algorithm with a user-friendly Tkinter interface to efficiently assign 
students while managing constraints specific to each tutor such as capacities taken on and 
individual student-faculty preferences. The solution provides a service that streamlines the 
annual process of initial allocation of incoming students to tutors.

This repo contains all code and data files created during development and testing of the system.
